Website project 1 html fundamentals
First commit on this project. This project is about learning the fundamentals of html.

In this first project, I built a website using HTML to show healthy recipes. Linked to the index page are 3 recipes: Vegan Lasagna, Baked Sweet Potato, and a Healthy Green Smoothie all provided with a description, ingredients, and directions to follow.
